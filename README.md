Feature Description
The Product Management System contains 3 distinct functions:
1. Complete a Purchase
2. Register a Premium Member
3. View Inventory / Sort Inventory
Additionally, to these 3 primary functions, we also have the ability to perform 
management task under the Store Manager Tab. The manager can store customers in a 
database which allows him to track memberships, payment methods and total spent by 
customers who are currently registered with the store. The manager also has the ability to 
view inventory before and after a purchase is completed and can add / remove inventory 
at his/ her discretion.
1. Complete a Purchase
      a. When completing a purchase the customer will be asked if he wants to order 
Books, CDs, or DVDs until him/ her elects to either a) view the shopping cart

they have elected to order and the total cost of that purchase. The customer 
database managed by the Store manager is simultaneously updated with the 
total spent by that particular customer.

system is updated and removes the items that customers add.
